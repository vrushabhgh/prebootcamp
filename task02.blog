2)copy by value:
*The value is actually copied; there are two distinct, independent copies. 
*Primitive values in JavaScript will not be shared between multiple variables . 
Even if you set the variables equal to each other. Every variable representing a primitive value is guaranteed to belong to a unique memory location.

*This means none of the variables will ever point to the same memory address. 
It is also important that the value itself is stored in a physical memory location.

*In our example when we declare b = a, b will point to a different memory address with the same ‘string’ value right away. 
So you don’t need to reassign a to point to a different memory address.

*This is called copied by value since you have no access to the memory address only to the value.



2)copy By Reference :
*Only a reference to the value is copied. If the value is modified through the new reference, that change is also visible through the original reference.
*When you assign a variable, it is a reference to an object not the object itself. When you copy an object b = a both variables will point to the same address.
This behavior is called copy by reference value.


3) copy by value a composite datatype (array+objects).
1)1. Using Spread:
Spread operator allows an iterable to expand in places where 0+ arguments are expected.
It is mostly used in the variable array where there is more than 1 values are expected. 
It allows us the privilege to obtain a list of parameters from an array.Using spread will clone your object. Note this will be a shallow copy.

2. Using Object.assign():
The Object.assign() method copies all enumerable own properties from one or more source objects to a target object. 
It returns the target object. Note this will be a shallow copy

3. Using JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify():
The JSON object, available in all modern browsers, has two useful methods to deal with JSON-formatted content: parse and stringify.
JSON.parse() takes a JSON string and transforms it into a JavaScript object.
JSON.stringify() takes a JavaScript object and transforms it into a JSON string.Using JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify() for copy performs deep copy .
